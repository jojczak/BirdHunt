about_p1=Hi! Thanks for playing Bird Hunt.
about_p2=Here's how to properly launch the game:
about_p3=Due to the fact that the S Pen Remote API hasn't been updated by Samsung for the past 5 years (Samsung, update this lib pls), there may be some bugs related to connectivity.\nFor the game to correctly handle the S Pen, you MUST REMOVE THE S PEN FROM THE DEVICE BEFORE LAUNCHING THE GAME AND WAIT FOR A SUCCESSFUL CONNECTION, INDICATED BY THIS ICON IN THE STATUS BAR:
about_p4=LAUNCH THE GAME ONLY AFTER SUCCESSFUL CONNECTION. Otherwise, the game may not detect the S Pen at all or may only respond to its movement only when the button on the S Pen is pressed.
about_p5=Game should work on Galaxy Note10 or newer devices, as well as Galaxy tablets that support the S Pen Remote. However, I've only tested it on the S23 Ultra, so feel free to let me know how the game performs on your device.
about_p6=Consider this game more of a tech demo than a full-fledged game - I wanted to see what interesting things could be done with the S Pen ;)
about_p7=This game was written in Kotlin using the libGDX framework and you can find the source code on GitHub:
